#  Culinary AI Photographer

Transform your simple food photos into delicious, professional-grade masterpieces with the power of AI. This web application provides an easy-to-use interface to upload a food image, and our AI assistant will transform it into a stunning, professional-quality photograph with a perfect 1:1 aspect ratio, ready for your food blog or social media.

## ✨ Features

-   **AI-Powered Image Transformation**: Utilizes Google's Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash-image`) to intelligently edit and enhance food photos.
-   **Contextual Presentation AI**: The AI prompt is specifically designed to create a presentation (plating, utensils, setting) that is authentic and contextual to the specific food, enhancing its appeal.
-   **Enlarge Image View**: Click on the generated AI photo to view it in a full-screen modal, perfect for appreciating the details.
-   **Download Generated Image**: Easily save the high-quality, AI-generated photo to your device with a single click.
-   **Simple File Upload**: Upload your food images (JPEG, PNG, WebP) from your device with a simple, clickable interface.
-   **Contextual Prompts**: Add a text label (e.g., "Spaghetti Bolognese") to give the AI more context for better, more accurate results.
-   **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Instantly compare your original photo with the professionally generated image.
-   **Responsive Design**: A clean, modern, and fully responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS that works beautifully on all devices.
-   **Loading & Error States**: Clear feedback for users during image processing and for any potential errors.

## 🚀 How It Works

This application is a single-page web app built with modern frontend technologies.

1.  **Image Upload**: The user selects a food photo from their computer. The app reads the file and displays it as a preview.
2.  **AI Prompting**: The user can optionally provide a text label for the food. When the "Make it Professional" button is clicked, the app sends the image data and a carefully crafted text prompt to the Gemini API.
3.  **Gemini API Call**: The `gemini-2.5-flash-image` model processes the input image and text. The prompt instructs the AI to act as a professional food photographer, reimagining the plating, utensils, and setting to be authentic and contextual to the dish. It focuses on professional lighting, composition, color, and texture, while ensuring a 1:1 aspect ratio.
4.  **Display & Interact**: The API returns the newly generated image, which is then displayed alongside the original. The user can click to enlarge the new image or download it directly.

## ⚙️ Setup and Running

To run this project, you need to have an environment that can serve the static files and provide the necessary API key.

1.  **Clone the repository** (or have the project files).
2.  **Set up your API Key**: The application requires a Google Gemini API key. This key must be available as an environment variable named `API_KEY`.

    ```
    # In your environment setup (e.g., .env file or server configuration)
    API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

3.  **Serve the files**: Use a simple local server to host the `index.html` and its associated JavaScript/TypeScript files.
